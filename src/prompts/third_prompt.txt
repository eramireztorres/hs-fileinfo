You are given a Python method that receives an input path and additional information in a dictionary. The current method's purpose is to return a dictionary that includes the original path and relevant information extracted from the file. The current method and the last result it produced are provided below.

Current Method:
{}
Last Result:
{}

=== SEPARATOR ===

Objective:
Your task is to improve this method to extract as much additional information as possible in text form from the file specified by the path. The improved method should handle the specific file type provided in the last result and extract relevant additional information for that type only. The original path and any previously extracted information must always be included in the returned dictionary.

The improved method must:
- Ensure the initial test (returning the path) continues to work.
- Try to import any necessary modules within a try block and proceed only if the import is successful.
- Return only the executable code for the new method without any comments, markdown formatting, or additional text.
- Focus exclusively on improving the additional information extraction for the specific file type provided in the last result. Do not generalize to other file types.
